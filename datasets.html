            <h1>Datasets</h1>

            <h2>Training datasets</h2>
	  <p>
	  These are labeled datasets that allow the proponents to
	  train their algorithms. The goal here is to provide some
	  comfort with the dataset format and how to process the
	  information. The datasets include targets to enable the
	  training. However, since the goal of this challenge is to
	  extrapoloate, the full parameter space (time and/or
	  channels) in the final dataset  are incomplete. The goal of
	  this dataset is to understand the behavior. 	  
            </p>

            <h2>Validation/evaluation datasets</h2>

             <p>
             We provide a private validation dataset to allow
             participants to test their models for submission. The
             evaluation metrics match those of the overall test dataset
	     scoring. This evaluation (and the inference) is performed
             on the Codabench server, which currently consists of A10s
             on the San Diego Super Computing cluster's NSF National
             Research Platform.  
            </p>

            <h2>Final Challenge datasets</h2>

            <p>
            Performance on the Final challenge datasets will
            determine challenge scores. Please see the individual
            challenges for more details on their evaluation. Submission
            scoring code is provided on each challenge's GitHub
            repository as well. These datasets will be publicly released
            after the competition. As with validation, the scoring is performed
            on the Codabench server, which currently consists of A10s
            on the San Diego Super Computing cluster's NSF National
            Research Platform.
